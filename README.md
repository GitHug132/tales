# Tales
Short stories about how to write programs

## Motivation
This is just an idea that came around recently, and it's still under development. So!, there are many different ways to write programms. Some of them are The classical TDD, the modern BDD and the ultra-modern Cucumber DSL. Cucumber offers a very new perspective about how to write programs driving the development by writing short stories. Those ones have an specific structure like "features", "scenarios", and "steps" (given-when-then). The central idea that I follow is _to tell the story in a manner that you feel good._

## Tale's definition
We can write any __story__ or __tale__  by following a simple structure.
```
The first line is the title
The next lines are the description
so we can write a short or a long story
about how the title should be interpreted

    This title is a sub-tale for the tile above
    And we write this sub-tale in order to detail
    some specific points about the main story

    And this second title is also a sub-tale

    So we can keep on listing as many task as is needed
    In order to tell to the programer what we want
    as result. This story is similar to any story written
    in DSL and the only difference is that this story has
    a very simple structure

    Like python

So this second main-story's title goes here
With its description
```

As we see in the example, we write a simple story bearing in mind the tabulations. Tabulations like in Python define _sub-modules_.

## Wire the tale
If we've a __tale__ then we should run this tale against some specs.
